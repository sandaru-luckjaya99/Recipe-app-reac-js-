          {/* amount per month or quarter or half-year, or year. Customers also get
          their delicious food delivered or picked up at a very reasonable cost
          as restaurants do not need to charge an extra amount on food due to a
          0% commission on the order. FoodieHub offers 30 days free trial to
          restaurants. After the expiry of the free trial, the restaurant has to
          buy any of subscriptions monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or yearly. */}
